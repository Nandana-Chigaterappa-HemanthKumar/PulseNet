Problematic Internet Use (PIU) among kids and
teenagers is a growing problem in today’s digital age, contributing
to mental health issues like anxiety and sadness. With the tech-
driven environment completely encapsulating us, it is essential to
recognize and treat problematic internet use early on to promote
mental health and prevent long-term psychological repercussions.
This project aims to develop machine learning models that predict
the Severity Impairment Index (sii), which measures problematic
internet use, by leveraging physical activity and internet usage
data from the Healthy Brain Network (HBN) as a part of the
Kaggle Competition, “Child Mind Institute – Problematic Inter-
net Use”. The dataset includes accelerometer (actigraphy) data,
fitness assessments, and various behavioral measures collected
from a Questionnaire. This project focuses on implementing
four machine learning models: Random Forest, Support Vector
Machines (SVM), Logistic Regression, and Clustering on this
data. Each model will analyze the relationship between physical
activity and problematic internet use to identify early indicators
of compulsive or excessive digital behavior. By comparing the
performance of these models based on metrics such as accuracy,
precision, and recall, this project will determine the most effective
approach for predicting problematic internet use.
